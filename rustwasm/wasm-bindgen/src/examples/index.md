# Examples of using `wasm-bindgen`, `js-sys`, and `web-sys`

This subsection contains examples of using the `wasm-bindgen`, `js-sys`, and
`web-sys` crates. Each example should have more information about what it's
doing.

The source code for all examples can also be [found online][code] to download an
run locally. Each example is accompanied with a `build.sh` script to outline the
steps necessary to build and run it as well.

Note that most examples currently use Webpack to assemble the final output
artifact, but this is not required! You can use the bundler of choice,
`--no-modules`, or native browser ESM support as alternatives to Webpack.
